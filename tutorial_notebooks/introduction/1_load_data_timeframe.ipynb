    "# TemporalScope Tutorial: TimeFrame and Backend-Agnostic Data Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "## TimeFrame Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TimeFrame` class supports two key modes for handling temporal data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implicit & Static Time Series** (Default Mode):\n",
    "   - Time column is treated as a feature for static modeling\n",
    "   - Supports mixed-frequency workflows\n",
    "   - No strict temporal ordering enforced\n",
    "   - Use when: Building ML models where time is just another feature\n",
    "   - Example: `enforce_temporal_uniqueness=False` (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strict Time Series**:\n",
    "   - Enforces strict temporal ordering and uniqueness\n",
    "   - Suitable for forecasting tasks\n",
    "   - Can validate by groups using `id_col`\n",
    "   - Use when: Building forecasting models requiring temporal integrity\n",
    "   - Example: `enforce_temporal_uniqueness=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Engineering Design Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TimeFrame` class is designed with several key assumptions to ensure performance, scalability, and flexibility across temporal XAI workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessed Data Assumption**:\n",
    "   - TemporalScope assumes users provide clean, preprocessed data\n",
    "   - Similar to TensorFlow and GluonTS, preprocessing (categorical encoding, missing data, scaling) should be handled before using TemporalScope\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Column Constraints**:\n",
    "   - `time_col` must be numeric index or timestamp\n",
    "   - Critical for operations like sliding window partitioning and temporal XAI (e.g., MASV computations)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numeric Features Requirement**:\n",
    "   - All features (except `time_col`) must be numeric\n",
    "   - Ensures compatibility with ML models and XAI techniques like SHAP\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Universal Model Assumption**:\n",
    "   - Models operate on entire dataset without hidden groupings\n",
    "   - Enables seamless integration with SHAP, Boruta-SHAP, and LIME\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend Support\n",
    "\n",
    "TemporalScope supports multiple DataFrame backends through its core utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Core Backends**:\n",
    "  - `pandas`: Core DataFrame library\n",
    "  - `modin`: Parallelized Pandas operations\n",
    "  - `pyarrow`: Apache Arrow-based processing\n",
    "  - `polars`: High-performance Rust implementation\n",
    "  - `dask`: Distributed computing framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates loading data with pandas, polars, and modin as examples, but the principles apply across all supported backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "TimeFrame's primary purpose is ensuring data quality and compatibility for:\n",
    "- Computing Mean Absolute SHAP Values (MASV) on partitions\n",
    "- Temporal feature importance analysis\n",
    "- Integration with model-agnostic explainability tools\n",
    "\n",
    "By validating data upfront, TimeFrame ensures reliable XAI workflows downstream.\n",

    "# Example 2: Group-Level Temporal Uniqueness Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The TimeFrame class supports validation of temporal uniqueness at the group level, which is essential for multi-entity time series applications. When enabled, this validation ensures that within each group (defined by id_col), timestamps are unique, while different groups can share the same timestamps. This aligns with modern approaches in time series analysis where multiple entities can be observed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- `enforce_temporal_uniqueness`: When True, ensures unique timestamps within each group\n",
    "- `id_col`: Defines the grouping entity (e.g., patient_id, sensor_id)\n",
    "- Different groups can have events at the same timestamps\n",
    "- Supports mixed-frequency and asynchronous observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Modern machine learning and deep learning frameworks often treat observations as IID (Independent and Identically Distributed), making strict temporal ordering optional. This includes recent transformer architectures that can learn from irregularly sampled or mixed-frequency data. The choice of temporal validation should match your specific modeling requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Domain | Use Case | Group-Level Uniqueness | Cross-Group Flexibility |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|\n",
    "| Time Series Forecasting | Multi-asset price prediction | Each asset requires unique timestamps in its history | Different assets can share observation times |\n",

    "| IoT Monitoring | Multi-sensor networks | Each sensor needs unique reading times | Different sensors can record simultaneously |\n",
    "| Anomaly Detection | Multi-system monitoring | Each system needs unique state recordings | Different systems can have concurrent states |\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with findings in recent literature on universal time series representation learning (Trirat et al., 2024) and mixed-frequency forecasting (Filho et al., 2024), where group-level temporal consistency is maintained while allowing cross-group temporal overlap."
