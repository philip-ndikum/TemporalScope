"""TemporalScope/src/temporalscope/partition/base_protocol.py.

This module defines the TemporalPartitionerProtocol, a protocol for all
temporal partitioning methods. Each partitioning method must implement
the required methods to comply with this protocol. Currently, only single-target
workflows (scalar targets) are supported. Multi-target workflows (sequence or tensor
targets) are planned for future releases. This protocol is designed to be flexible
enough to accommodate both modes when multi-target support is added.

Partitioning for modern XAI Time-Series Pipelines:
--------------------------------------------------
Partitioning is foundational to modern time-series workflows. It ensures computational efficiency,
robust validation, and interpretable insights. Key use cases include:

+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Aspect                     | Details                                                                           |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Temporal Explainability    | Facilitates feature importance analyses by segmenting data for localized          |
|                            | SHAP/WindowSHAP metrics.                                                          |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Robust Evaluation          | Respects temporal ordering in train-test splits, critical for time-series         |
|                            | generalization.                                                                   |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Scalability and Efficiency | Supports sliding windows, expanding windows, and fixed partitions with            |
|                            | lazy-loading and backend compatibility for large-scale datasets.                  |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Workflow Flexibility       | Supports both single-target and multi-target modes, enabling DataFrame            |
|                            | operations and deep learning pipelines through flexible partitioning methods.     |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Core Functionality:
-------------------
The protocol defines four mandatory methods, ensuring a strict and consistent lifecycle across all partitioning implementations.
Each method has a clear purpose and aligns with the goals of efficient partitioning:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Method          | Description                                                                       |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| setup           | Prepares and validates input data, ensuring compatibility with the chosen         |
|                 | workflow (e.g., backend conversions, deduplication, parameter checks).            |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| fit             | Generates partition indices (row ranges) for datasets, supporting sliding         |
|                 | windows, fixed-length, or expanding partitions.                                   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| transform       | Applies the partition indices to retrieve specific data slices, ensuring          |
|                 | memory-efficient operation using lazy evaluation techniques.                      |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| fit_transform   | Combines `fit` and `transform` for eager workflows, directly producing            |
|                 | partitioned data slices.                                                          |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Workflow Modes:
---------------
The protocol supports two primary modes:

1. Single-Target (DataFrame-Centric):
   - Operations focus on Narwhals-backed DataFrames (Pandas, Polars, or Modin).
   - Slices are returned in DataFrame formats, preserving metadata.

2. Multi-Target (Tensor/Dataset-Centric):
   - Designed for deep learning workflows (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
   - Handles transformations from DataFrame to tensor or dataset formats.
   - Ensures compatibility with sequence or tensor-target models.

Future Plans:
-------------
The protocol is designed for extensibility, ensuring advanced workflows like multi-modal models, cross-frequency partitioning,
or custom padding strategies can be integrated seamlessly.
