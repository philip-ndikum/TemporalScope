coverage:
  status:
    project:
      default:
        target: auto          # Automatically adjusts based on the current project coverage
        threshold: 80%        # Allow up to an 80% drop in overall coverage during beta phase
        # Note: This permits a large drop in overall project coverage during the fast-paced development phase.

    patch:
      default:
        informational: true   # Informational only; won't fail the pipeline
        target: 5%            # Set a minimal target of 5% coverage for new code patches
        threshold: 90%        # Allow up to a 90% drop on new code coverage (extremely lenient)
        # Note: This ensures that even with low coverage, the pipeline wonâ€™t block PRs, but you still get coverage insights.
