**TemporalScope** is a lightweight, open-source software (OSS) Python package designed to analyze and understand the temporal dynamics of feature importance in machine learning models. Licensed under the Apache 2.0 License and developed with Linux Foundation standards, TemporalScope provides a straightforward API to track and visualize how feature importance evolves over time, enabling deeper insights into temporal data patterns. This tool is ideal for researchers and practitioners who need to account for temporal variations in feature importance in their predictive models.

## **Why use TemporalScope?**

1. **Addressing Non-Stationarity**: Research has shown that using SHAP or causal methods on a single dataset can be insufficient due to non-stationarityâ€”changes in data distribution over time. **TemporalScope** directly addresses this challenge, offering a more nuanced and accurate analysis of feature importance.

2. **Built on Cutting-Edge Research**: **TemporalScope** is grounded in the latest scientific literature, designed to solve a critical problem faced by analysts, scientists, and quantitative professionals worldwide. It allows for a deeper understanding of how features influence model predictions over time, helping to uncover hidden patterns and insights.

3. **Standards and Scalability**: Developed according to Linux Foundation standards, **TemporalScope** offers robust documentation and a lean, scalable approach. Driven by the scientific community we hope to attract developers to help us improve the software through time.


## **Installation**

You can install TemporalScope from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temporalscope/) with:

1. **Basic Installation using pip**:

   `pip install temporalscope`

2. **Installation with Optional Dependencies**: If you want to use additional backends like Dask, Modin, CUDF, or Polars, you can install them as follows:

   `pip install temporalscope[dask,modin,cudf,polars]`


## **Usage**

You can use TemporalScope with the following steps:

1. **Import TemporalScope**: Start by importing the package.
2. **Select Backend (Optional)**: TemporalScope defaults to using Pandas as the backend. However, you can specify other backends like Dask, Modin, or CuDF.
3. **Load Data**: Load your time series data into the `TimeSeriesData` class, specifying the `time_col` and optionally the `id_col`. 
4. **Apply a Feature Importance Method**: TemporalScope defaults to using a Random Forest model from scikit-learn if no model is specified. You can either:
    - **A. Use a pre-trained model**: Pass a pre-trained model to the method.
    - **B. Train a Random Forest model within the method**: TemporalScope handles model training and application automatically.
5. **Analyze and Visualize Results**: Interpret the results to understand how feature importance evolves over time or across different phases.

Now, let's refine the code example using a random forest model and an academic dataset. We'll use the California housing dataset as a simple example since it's well-known and accessible.

```python
import polars as pl
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.datasets import macrodata
from temporalscope.core.temporal_data_loader import TimeFrame
from temporalscope.partioning.naive_partitioner import NaivePartitioner
from temporalscope.core.temporal_model_trainer import TemporalModelTrainer

# 1. Load the dataset using Pandas (or convert to Polars)
macro_df = macrodata.load_pandas().data
macro_df['time'] = pd.date_range(start='1959-01-01', periods=len(macro_df), freq='Q')

# Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Polars DataFrame
macro_df_polars = pl.DataFrame(macro_df)

# 2. Initialize the TimeFrame object with the data
economic_tf = TimeFrame(
    df=macro_df_polars,
    time_col='time',
    target_col='realgdp',
    backend='pl',  # Using Polars as the backend
)

# 3. Apply Partitioning Strategy (like sklearn's train_test_split)
partitioner = NaivePartitioner(economic_tf)
partitioned_data = partitioner.apply()  # Returns a list of partitioned dataframes

# 4. Train and evaluate the model using the partitioned data
model_trainer = TemporalModelTrainer(
    partitioned_data=partitioned_data,  # Directly passing the partitioned data
    model=None,  # Use the default model (LightGBM)
    model_params={
        'objective': 'regression',
        'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
        'metric': 'rmse',
        'verbosity': -1
    }
)

# 5. Execute the training and evaluate
results = model_trainer.train_and_evaluate()

# Output predictions and metrics
for partition_name, predictions in results.items():
    print(f"Predictions for {partition_name}:")
    print(predictions[:5])  # Display first 5 predictions
```
