**TemporalScope** is an innovative Python package designed to analyze and understand the temporal dynamics of feature importance across various machine learning models. Unlike traditional methods that treat feature importance as static, TemporalScope allows you to explore how feature importance evolves over time or across different data segments.

## **Installation**

You can install TemporalScope from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temporalscope/) with:

- **Install using pip**: `pip install temporalscope`

## **Usage**

Hereâ€™s how you can use TemporalScope:

- **Import the package**: `import temporalscope`
- **Analyze temporal feature importance**: Use the package's functions to explore how feature importance changes over time.

### **Example Use Cases**

| **Sector**    | **Use Case**                                                                                  | **Impact**                                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Finance**   | Analyzing how the importance of financial indicators changes across different market cycles.   | Improves investment strategies by understanding how market conditions affect the relevance of indicators. |
| **Healthcare**| Tracking how patient data features contribute to health outcomes at various stages of treatment.| Enables personalized treatment plans by identifying critical features at different treatment phases.  |
| **Engineering**| Examining the impact of factors on machinery lifecycle, guiding maintenance schedules.        | Reduces downtime and maintenance costs by understanding how wear and tear affect feature importance.  |

## **Technical Methods**

TemporalScope leverages advanced methodologies to provide a comprehensive analysis of temporal feature importance. Each method is designed to tackle specific aspects of non-stationarity and data segmentation:

| **Method**                         | **Description**                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reverse Expanding Window**       | Analyzes feature importance by incrementally expanding the data window, tracking how importance evolves over time. |
| **Partitioning Approach**          | Segments data into distinct phases (e.g., time-based) and examines feature importance within each segment.|
| **WinIT Approach**                 | Captures temporal dependencies by summarizing feature importance across a moving window of past data points.|

## **Development Roadmap**

We have a clear vision for the future development of TemporalScope. Our roadmap outlines the planned features and the stages of development:
