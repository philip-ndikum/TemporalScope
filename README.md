**TemporalScope** is an open-source Python package designed to bridge the gap between scientific research and practical industry applications for analyzing the temporal dynamics of feature importance in AI & ML time series models. Developed in alignment with Linux Foundation standards and licensed under Apache 2.0, it builds on tools such as Boruta-SHAP and SHAP, using modern window partitioning algorithms to tackle challenges like non-stationarity and concept drift.  This package is flexible and extensible, supporting frameworks like **Pandas, Polars, Modin, Dask, and PyArrow** via **native Narwhals compatibility**. Additionally, the optional _Clara LLM_ modules (etymology from the word _Clarity_) are intended to serve as a model-validation tool to support explainability efforts (XAI). **Note**: TemporalScope is currently in **beta and pre-release** phase, so some installation methods may not work as expected on all platforms. Please check the `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` for the full roadmap.

## **Installation**

**Note**: TemporalScope is currently in **beta**, so some installation methods may not work as expected on all platforms.

1. **Basic Installation using pip**: You can install the core package using pip:
   ```console
   $ pip install temporalscope
   ```
2. **Installation with conda**: For conda users, install via conda-forge:
   ```console
   $ conda install -c conda-forge temporalscope
   ```
3. **System-level Dependencies**: To view generated documentation locally, you may need `xdg-open`:
   ```console
   $ sudo apt install xdg-utils
   ```
4. **Git Clone and Setup**: For security reasons, we minimize system-level dependencies. If you prefer the latest development version, follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the project using Hatch:

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/philip-ndikum/TemporalScope.git
   $ cd TemporalScope
   $ hatch shell
   ```

   This process clones the repository, navigates to the project directory, and uses Hatch to create and activate a virtual environment with the project installed in development mode.

## **Usage**

You can use TemporalScope with the following steps:

1. **Import TemporalScope**: Start by importing the package.
2. **Select Backend (Optional)**: TemporalScope defaults to using Pandas as the backend. However, you can specify other backends like Dask, Modin, or CuDF.
3. **Load Data**: Load your time series data into the `TimeSeriesData` class, specifying the `time_col` and optionally the `id_col`.
4. **Apply a Feature Importance Method**: TemporalScope defaults to using a Random Forest model from scikit-learn if no model is specified. You can either:
   - **A. Use a pre-trained model**: Pass a pre-trained model to the method.
   - **B. Train a Random Forest model within the method**: TemporalScope handles model training and application automatically.
5. **Analyze and Visualize Results**: Interpret the results to understand how feature importance evolves over time or across different phases.

Now, let's refine the code example using a random forest model and an academic dataset. We'll use the California housing dataset as a simple example since it's well-known and accessible.

```python
import polars as pl
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.datasets import macrodata
from temporalscope.core.temporal_data_loader import TimeFrame
from temporalscope.partitioning.naive_partitioner import NaivePartitioner
from temporalscope.core.temporal_model_trainer import TemporalModelTrainer

# 1. Load the dataset using Pandas (or convert to Polars)
macro_df = macrodata.load_pandas().data
macro_df['time'] = pd.date_range(start='1959-01-01', periods=len(macro_df), freq='Q')

# Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Polars DataFrame
macro_df_polars = pl.DataFrame(macro_df)

# 2. Initialize the TimeFrame object with the data
economic_tf = TimeFrame(
    df=macro_df_polars,
    time_col='time',
    target_col='realgdp',
    backend='pl',  # Using Polars as the backend
)

# 3. Apply Partitioning Strategy (like sklearn's train_test_split)
partitioner = NaivePartitioner(economic_tf)
partitioned_data = partitioner.apply()  # Returns a list of partitioned dataframes

# 4. Train and evaluate the model using the partitioned data
model_trainer = TemporalModelTrainer(
    partitioned_data=partitioned_data,  # Directly passing the partitioned data
    model=None,  # Use the default model (LightGBM)
    model_params={
        'objective': 'regression',
        'boosting_type': 'gbdt',
        'metric': 'rmse',
        'verbosity': -1
    }
)

# 5. Execute the training and evaluate
results = model_trainer.train_and_evaluate()

# Output predictions and metrics
for partition_name, predictions in results.items():
    print(f"Predictions for {partition_name}:")
    print(predictions[:5])  # Display first 5 predictions
```
