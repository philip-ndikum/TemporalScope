## Development Roadmap & Changelog

**TemporalScope** follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**, a versioning system that conveys the scope of changes introduced in each new release. Each version is represented in the form **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, where major releases introduce significant or breaking changes, minor releases add backward-compatible functionality, and patch releases are used for bug fixes or minor improvements. Below is the planned roadmap outlining feature development and milestones over the next 12–18 months. This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, emerging research, and community contributions.
