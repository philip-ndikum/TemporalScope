2. Clone a local copy of your fork:

   ```console
   $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/TemporalScope.git
   ```

   or

   ```console
   $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TemporalScope.git
   ```

## Setup Development Environment

TemporalScope uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), a Python project manager, for managing virtual environments, building the project, and publishing packages.

1. Install Hatch by following the [installation instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) for your operating system.
2. Verify the installation (your version number may differ):

   ```console
   $ cd TemporalScope
   $ hatch version
   0.1.0
   ```

## Install Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. Set up the git hook scripts:

```console
$ pre-commit install
```

## Create a New Branch

Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your changes:

```console
$ git switch -c <descriptive-branch-name>
```

## Make Your Changes

1. Make the necessary code changes in your local repository.
2. Write or update tests as needed.
3. Update documentation if you're introducing new features or changing existing functionality.

## Ensure Code Quality

TemporalScope employs various tools to maintain consistent code style, quality, and static type checking. While the CI pipeline tests code quality, running these checks locally expedites the review cycle.

Before submitting your changes, perform the following steps:

1. Run the test suite and type checking:

```console
$ hatch run test:type
```

2. Check your code format:

```console
$ hatch run format-check
```

3. Format your code (if needed):

```console
$ hatch run format
```

4. Check your code style according to linting rules:

```console
$ hatch run check
```

5. Automatically fix some errors (when possible):

```console
$ hatch run fix
```

> [!NOTE]
> Running these checks locally will help identify and resolve issues before submitting your changes, streamlining the review process.

Here's the revised version of that section:

## Commit Your Changes

1. Stage your changes:

   ```console
   $ git add [args]
   ```

   This command allows you to review and selectively stage parts of your changes.

2. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification:

   ```console

## Test Policy

TemporalScope prioritizes code quality, security, and stability. To uphold these standards:

1. New functionality should include corresponding tests.
2. [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is our primary testing framework.
3. Required test types:

   - Unit tests for all new features
   - Integration tests where applicable

4. Test coverage should include:

   - Main functionality
   - Edge cases
   - Boundary conditions

5. Before pushing code:

   - Ensure all test pass locally

6. Test guidelines:
   - Keep tests simple and easy to understand
   - Follow PyTest [best practices](https://emimartin.me/pytest_best_practices)

This policy helps ensure code integrates well with the existing codebase and prevents future bugs or regressions.

## Development Roadmap & Changelog

**TemporalScope** follows **[Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)**, a versioning system that conveys the scope of changes introduced in each new release. Each version is represented in the form **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, where major releases introduce significant or breaking changes, minor releases add backward-compatible functionality, and patch releases are used for bug fixes or minor improvements. Below is the planned roadmap outlining feature development and milestones over the next 12â€“18 months. This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback, emerging research, and community contributions.

| **Version** | **Status**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **0.2.0**   | Planned     | This version will include more comprehensive end-to-end examples and tutorials designed to assist users in integrating the software into practical use cases across various domains.                 |
| **0.3.0**   | Planned     | Introduction of the Clara LLM module to analyze SHAP values and provide robotic model validation, offering deeper insights as a defensive layer of model verification.                               |
| **0.5.0**   | Planned     | Focused on achieving a stable release. This version will include extensive user testing, bug fixes, and performance optimizations after several months of use in diverse environments.               |
| **1.0.0**   | Stable      | The first fully stable release, with robust documentation, thorough testing, and any feedback-driven refinements. This version will be ready for broader production use and long-term support.       |

## Workflow for Releasing New Versions

In order to maintain consistency and clarity across different distribution platforms like **PyPI**, **Conda**, and **GitHub**, we follow a structured workflow for releasing new versions:

1. **Update the `CHANGELOG.md` File**:
   - Ensure that all the changes (new features, bug fixes, deprecations, and breaking changes) are accurately recorded in the `CHANGELOG.md`.
   - Each release should include a brief summary of changes, structured by categories like **Features**, **Fixes**, and **Breaking Changes**.
2. **Generate Release Notes**:
   - Use the information from the `CHANGELOG.md` to create consistent **release notes**.
   - Ensure that the release notes are in a uniform format for each platform:
     - **PyPI**: Include a summary of the changes in the release description.
     - **Conda**: Similar release notes can be included when publishing to **Conda**.
     - **GitHub**: Publish the release notes in the **GitHub Releases** section.
3. **Distribute to Each Platform**:
   - **PyPI**: Push the package using `hatch` after running the necessary build commands.
   - **Conda**: Ensure the package is properly built for **Conda** and distributed to the Conda package manager.
   - **GitHub**: Create a **GitHub Release**, attaching the release notes, and tagging the release in the repository.
4. **Verify the Release**:
   - Ensure all distribution platforms (PyPI, Conda, GitHub) reflect the new release.
   - Test the installation via `pip install temporalscope` and `conda install temporalscope` to ensure everything works as expected.

By following this workflow, we ensure a consistent and smooth release process across all distribution channels, providing users with clear updates and robust software. We use HTTPS and SSH to protect against **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** during the delivery process. However, **digital signatures** are not currently implemented, as the current security measures are sufficient for the project's scope. We will revisit this as the project scales and requires additional security layers.

## Code Style

We strictly enforce code quality and style to ensure the stability and maintainability of the project.

- **[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff)** formatting and linting
- **[Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** type checking
- **[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)** guidelines are followed for Python code style.
- **[Sphinx-style docstrings](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)** with type hints are required to conform to **MyPy** standards, enabling early error detection.
- Write clear and concise commit messages. Adhere to [conventional commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Include comments and docstrings where necessary to improve code readability.

## Reporting Issues & Requesting Features

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please read our `SECURITY.md` for instructions on managing security issues. Alternatively, utilize the Github Discussions to raise issues or potential long term features.
